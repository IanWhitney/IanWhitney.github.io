I've visited Reykjavik twice before, both in the early 2000s. Those visits were in March, which is not prime tourist season, and the Reykjavik I visited was mostly quiet. The air cold, the sun below the horizon most of the time, the streets and businesses populated mostly by residents. I liked it a lot.

My recollection is that in 2002 Iceland was largely thought of a party destination; college kids would come for spring break or summer vacation and dance the night away.

This is not to say that tourists were uncommon. Iceland Air offered the "Free Stopover in Iceland" deal that has become their mainstay (and was the reason I was visiting Reykjavik at all). Tours to visit glaciers or horses were available, though maybe not in March. The Blue Lagoon already charged steep prices for their Instagram-ready pools (though Instagram itself did not exist). There was definitely a tourist industry, but not an especially intrusive one, though there were signs that this was changing. The airport was expanding, fancier shops were appearing in downtown, etc.

(note: all of these memories are hazy and may be inaccurate)

15 years later and the tourism industry has not just grown, it has metastasized. We left the airport on one of two Iceland Air planes bound for Reykjavik that day. The second sold-out plane left just 10 minutes later. Judging by number of planes and people at Keflavik that scene had been repeated at each of Iceland Air's many US destinations.

To handle this glut of passengers, Keflavik has tripled in size. To sell them anything-and-everything (duty free!) the single store has been replaced by a mid-sized mall. Tour busses run non-stop, ferrying bleary passengers the 50km to Reykjavik (or elsewhere, as many other Icelandic towns have started to house Reykjavik's overflow).

Once the busses arrive the passengers join all of yesterday's (and the day before's, etc.) passengers in roaming the streets of Reykjavik, shopping at the seemingly endless supply of stores. Or, if shopping is not their thing, they sign 

 that quickly swamped the airport that had tripled in size since my last visit.
