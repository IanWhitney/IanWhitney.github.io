I've visited Reykjavik twice before, both in the early 2000s. Those visits were in March, which is not prime tourist season, and the Reykjavik I visited was mostly quiet. The air cold, the sun below the horizon most of the time, the streets and businesses populated mostly by residents. I liked it a lot.
