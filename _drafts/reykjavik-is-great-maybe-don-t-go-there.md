I've visited Reykjavik twice before, both in the early 2000s. Those visits were in March, which is not prime tourist season, and the Reykjavik I visited was mostly quiet. The air cold, the sun below the horizon most of the time, the streets and businesses populated mostly by residents. I ate a lot of skyr, hung out in tiny coffee shops and took it easy. I liked it a lot.

My recollection is that at this time Iceland was largely thought of a party destination; college kids would come for spring break or summer vacation and dance the night away. But those crowds came in the summer, not during the late winters when I visited.

This is not to say that tourists were uncommon. Iceland Air offered the "Free Stopover in Iceland" deal that has become their mainstay (and was the reason I was visiting Reykjavik at all). Tours to visit glaciers or horses were available, though maybe not in March. The Blue Lagoon already charged steep prices for their Instagram-ready pools (though Instagram itself did not exist). There was definitely a tourist industry but not an especially intrusive one. There were signs that this was changing. The airport was expanding, fancier shops were appearing in downtown, etc.

All of these memories are hazy and may be inaccurate. Reviewing my blog posts from those visits I see that I was also complaining about tourists in 2002, though I also see that my hotel cost a $28 a night and I was complaining that it was expensive. So, maybe 2002-me was an idiot? Regardless, these memories definitely informed my desire to return to Reykjavik this year with my wife and daughter.

16 years since my last visit the tourism industry has not just grown, it has metastasized. We left the airport on one of two Iceland Air planes bound for Reykjavik that day. The second sold-out plane left just 10 minutes later. Judging by number of planes and people at Keflavik that scene had been repeated at each of Iceland Air's many US and European destinations.

To handle this glut of passengers, Keflavik has tripled in size. To sell them anything-and-everything (duty free!) the single store has been replaced by a mid-sized mall. Tour busses run non-stop, ferrying bleary passengers 50km to Reykjavik (or elsewhere, as many other Icelandic towns have started to house Reykjavik's overflow).

Once the busses arrive the passengers join all of yesterday's (and the day before's, and so on) passengers in roaming the streets of Reykjavik, shopping at the seemingly endless supply of stores. Or, if shopping is not their thing, they sign up for one of the dozens of tours, each customizable to your level of luxury. Wherever they end up they're most likely with other visitors. Reykjavik's population is around 200,000. Roughly 2,000,000 tourists visited it last year. Anywhere you go you're more likely to end up with tourists than with locals. About the only place we didn't hear English was at Family Park And Zoo, a 40-minute walk from the heart of the city.

Somewhere, underneath all these people, was the city of Reykjavik and its residents, the reason I wanted to come back. But the tourists, by sheer number alone, push the city and its residents out of view.

This change between the city I remembered and the city I found became the main topic of conversation during the tours we took during our stay. Yes, we took tours. We were tourists, after all.

With a sample size of two (2!) actual Icelandic people that I managed to have long conversations with, I would say that their opinion of tourism is _mixed_. The life-long Reykjavik resident recognized all of the money and opportunity that the tourists brought, but also saw the destruction that came with it. Her friends could no longer afford to live in the city where they worked. Home ownership has become a fantasy as homes are divided into profitable airbnb apartments (we, ourselves, were staying at such an apartment). She was angry and sad that the visitors seemed to have so little interest in learning about our preserving the place that they visited.

Much of this was echoed by our other guide, who moved to Reykjavik from a small town on the north cost. Tourism gave him a job that he loved (he spent most of his time doing multi-day glacier tours), but he was tired of tourists that never looked up from their phones or who came to Iceland pursuing weird romantic ideals of Adventure or Purity.

However, he also saw that tourism meant that people his age could afford to stay in their small towns, thanks to the steady stream of tourists fleeing the crush of Reykjavik. Previously most of these folks would have moved to capital, or to a different country.

So, _mixed_.

Should you go to Iceland? I'm not sure. My advice to tourists is much like advice given to gentrifiers. Learn about where you're staying, support the things that make the place special, be humble, act like a guest, stay out of the way and be quiet.

But, much like gentrification, be aware that your visit comes with repercussions.
