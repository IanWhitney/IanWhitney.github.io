After a last-minute adjustment (goddamnit, Ellison) I was ready to vote in today’s primary. I was happy to see that my poling station had a strong and steady crowd. Turnout in my area is always strong but today seemed strong for a primary.

Not everyone I voted for is going to win today, but I’ll be happy to vote for nearly everyone in November.
