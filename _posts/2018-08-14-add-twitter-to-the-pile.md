Last week I turned off cross-posting from [http://ianwhitney.micro.blog](http://ianwhitney.micro.blog "http://ianwhitney.micro.blog") to Twitter and today I used [https://tweetdelete.net](https://tweetdelete.net "https://tweetdelete.net") to purge all my existing tweets. I have not yet deleted Twitter, because I still find it valuable to see the conversations happening there. 

If I can ever find a way to read Twitter without being a Twitter member I'll jump at the chance.
